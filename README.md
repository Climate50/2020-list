# Welcome to Climate 50
### The most to date, comprehensive and insightful annual global climate VC ranking
 
Dear Climate Community!
 
We’re [Contrarian Ventures](https://cventures.vc), an early-stage sustainable energy transition focused VC fund. We take climate and community seriously. We’re the founders of Climate 50 - the most to date, comprehensive and insightful global climate VC ranking for the climate community. We started Climate 50 as an annual ranking that aims to recognize the most impactful climate VC investors allocating capital to entrepreneurs moving us closer to the net-zero planet (we like to call them “climate + ve capital”).
 
The world’s most profound scientists tell us that 2020 was the point of no return. From this point onward – a coordinated, comprehensive, and long-term focused climate action must be taken. Looking back, technology has been the main tool to address society’s most pressing problems and move us forward. In previous instances, venture-backed businesses proved to be the most capable of building technology that delivered on its promise. We believe this climate crisis will be no different. Technology is the only way to move us closer to a net-zero planet.
 
We believe the urgency to act has never been more important. Venture Capital might not be the panacea to the climate crisis but can act as a catalyst for innovation. While some of the investors still hold a stigma about the 2006 Cleantech 1.0 boom and subsequent bust, we are certain that now the timing is very different. Timing in the venture capital context is one of the most, if not the most important factor for success. We have a clear change in the mindset. While back in the days the slogan was “thinking outside the barrel”, nowadays it is the realization that if we don’t act now, we will be left with quite a different option - “thinking outside the planet earth”.
 
Today, we come to three key realizations as an investor community:
- World’s carbon budget is finite 
- It is running out fast and at an accelerated pace 
- And there is no plan(et) B 

It is clear that more and more leaders in the venture capital and business community realize that. The climate on its own right has now become the new frontier in venture investing. This time the numbers indicate to us that it is having a clear zeitgeist-fit moment.
 
For us, launching Climate 50 is not simply another ranking or tap on the investor’s shoulders. Our broader mission is to raise awareness around the threat of climate change and help inspire more investors to join the climate fight and deploy more capital in what we believe is the most important cause humanity has ever faced.
 
In short, our master plan consists of 3 key elements:
- To build a respected 360-view climate VC ranking;
- To publish an in-depth annual report on VC investments in the climate sector;
- To gather Climate 50 leaders into an informal annual event dedicated to foster discussion and collaboration;
 
Again, we welcome you to Climate 50. This ranking is a tribute and inspiration for the climate community, and we hope it will act as a great reference point for investors, LPs, and most importantly – entrepreneurs! We need more capital to join this climate fight. Each day spent on fundraising could be allocated to building solutions. And we need to BUILD NOW!
 
We have kept this ranking very transparent, and you can see our methodology [here](/1%20-%20Methodology.md). In principle, this ranking is a 360-view assessment of global climate VC funds, considering Direct and Indirect criteria that we believe shapes and defines a great investor. Our ranking criteria are not limited to stereotypical VC measures of success such as a number of unicorns in the portfolio or exits done. We believe that Indirect criteria like brand awareness, community give-back initiatives, and founder's voice are equally important. Lastly, we did not forget you - the climate community. Your voice counts. We will have a public vote running till the 28th of February.
 
We are very thankful to our data partners [Dealroom](https://dealroom.co) and [Landscape](https://landscape.ventures/investors). Our team is looking forward to receiving community feedback and ideas to improve.
 
In the meantime, spread the news and cast your vote (!!).
